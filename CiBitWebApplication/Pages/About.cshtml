        <h4>Background and Motivation</h4>
        <p>
            In the academic world, research and progress are made by improving the work of others. Each academic research is standing on the shoulders of giants, whereas the work done by others is cited and referenced. However, these credentials are not tannable nor are they countable. That is the motivation for the new CiBit cryptocurrency, giving a countable coin for the academic citations.

            Although there are many perks for the highly cited, coming from their reputation, they are few and the mass of researchers can only wait for their breakthrough. From the other side there are many cryptocurrencies some are even targeted at the individual, but none target the academic world. CiBit is trying to answer both problems by giving a countable profit to the academic researchers in the form of cryptocurrency coins to be used in and by the academic world.
        </p>

        <h4>Aims and Objectives</h4>
        <p>
            The aim of CiBit is to attract academic institutions that will be used as the Banks of the decentralized cryptocurrency. They will be able to attract and reward their researchers by allowing them to use a unique coin accepted by the institution which in return offer their resources to continue the research thereby elevating the academic world.
